Hello, uploading all my code for my 2020 field qSIP experiment for scientific transparency and reproducability.
If you're reading this in the future, know hopefully there will be packages (in QIIME and otherwise) for qSIP pipelines you should use rather than this. But that didn't exist when I did this, so hence, my messy amatuer code.


Lv6-filt-frac  is the QIIME output of all fractions
Lv6-filt-tube_corrected is the QIIME output at the whole tube level.
FvL are biogeochemical analyses conducted in the lab and field
FvP are the generic site-specific properties measured.

Please reach out if you have questions/concerns. kyreed@mail.wvu.edu
